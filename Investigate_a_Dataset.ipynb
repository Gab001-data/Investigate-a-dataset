    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we will be investigating one hundred (100) thousand records of medical appointments in Brazil with the goal of determining if patients will show up for their medical appointments or not based on a number of variables.\n",
    "We will base investiagation on these columns present in the dataset;\n",
    "\n",
    "- __PatientID__ - a unique identifier for each patient\n",
    "- __AppointmentID__ - a unique identify for each appointment by an individual\n",
    "- __Gender__ - indicate if the patient is male or female\n",
    "- __ScheduledDay__ - the day appointment was booked\n",
    "- __AppointmentDay__ - day for appointment with medical expert\n",
    "- __Age__ - specify how old is the patient\n",
    "- __Neighbourhood__ - specify the location of the medical facility for which appointment will take place\n",
    "- __Scholarship__ - indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program 'Bolsa FamÃ­lia'\n",
    "- __Hipertension__ - indicates if the patient suffers from hipertension\n",
    "- __Diabetes__ - indicate if patient suffers from Diabetes\n",
    "- __Alcoholism__ - indicate if patient is an alcoholic\n",
    "- __Handcap__ - indicates if patient suffers any disability\n",
    "- __SMS_received__ - indicates if patient received one or more correspondence via sms\n",
    "- __No-Show__ - indicates if appointee showed up for their appointemen. if 'No' appointee showed up. if 'Yes' its a no-show\n",

    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    ">**Tip**: Clearly state one or more questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. You will address these questions in the **data analysis** and **conclusion** sections. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: Once you start coding, use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Also, **use good coding practices**, such as, define and use functions to avoid repetitive code. Use appropriate comments within the code cells, explanation in the mark-down cells, and meaningful variable names. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on variables/factors that will help predict if a patient will show up for their appointment or not. To acheive this, we will attempt to answer the following questions during the analysis;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do patient with specific medical conditions always show up for their appointment?\n",
    "- If the appointment day fall on a weekday or weekend, does it influence whether or a the patient show up for appointment?\n",
    "- Does the location of the facility contributes to a no-show?\n",
    "- Is the age of the patient a contributive factor to no-show?\n",
    "- Does Patient that receives one or more SMS show up for their appointments?\n",
    "- What factors are most important in determining if patients will show up for their schdeuled appointment?"

One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report."

You should compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data. Note that at least two or more kinds of plots should be created as part of the exploration, and you must  compare and show trends in the varied visualizations. \n",

Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables. You should explore at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.\n",
