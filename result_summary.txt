PROJECT SUMMARY

the following conclusions were derived base analysis result from the dataset.

- medical facilities should send sms communications to patients regarding their appointments.
as patients who receive sms are more likely to show up for their appointments as seen from analysis

- appointments should be fixed on weekdays rather than weekend as there is an increased
probabilty of patients pulling a no-show for weekend appointments. though we don't have enough
data to make decisive conclusions as to why more patients don't show up for weekend appointments

- facility location can affect if a patient shows up for appointments or not. although this is
dependent on other factors like if patients received sms from the facility or if patients that book
appointments are hypertensive as these are two important factors that have been identified for
patients that show up to their appointments.

- more children and middle aged patients tend to show up for their appointment

- more woment tend to not show up compared to their male counterpart. but we couldn't
establish a strong correlation between gender of patients and no-show as more women than
men also booked for an appointment.

Limitations;

- this analysis results may not be wholistic as we tend to establish relationship 
between few of the variables per time.
- also due to the numerious number of locations in the dataset only the top 10 with no-show was considered
in our analysis of location and only the outlier location were we experienced a 100% no-show was analyzed.
